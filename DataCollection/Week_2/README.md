## Week 2
-----------
Here, we have made some additional changes to the previous work from week 1.

The idea is to send, in each request, the text of the current page along with a summary of the previous pages. This way, the model can generate not only Q&A from the current page but also identify connections between it and the previous pages.

You will find in this folder the guide and the explained code.

Best regards,
